# PandoraTest
Directory for characterising Pandora's vertexing performance

## Plan for metrics to compare with PMA
Always comparing 
- Primary Pandora vertex, contained

with

- Closest PMA vertex, contained
- PMA with longest track, contained

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distance between reconstructed and true neutrino primary

Number of tracks coming out of the vertex

Longest track length

Sum of track Kinetic Energies out of vertex

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Once these comparisons have been made
Which performs best?

PMA still needs to train its algorithms to find the primary
- Reduction in performance because of this 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
